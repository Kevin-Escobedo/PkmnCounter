# PkmnCounter
Pokemon counter for shiny encounter


## Project
This project has been created just for fun as a way to improve in Android/Kotlin. 
I hope it could be of any help to any hardcore Pokemon fan for shiny pokémons hunt ;) 

## Contribution
I'm a real noob in both Android and Kotlin, even though I love those two languages very much. 
Don't hesitate to give my your insight about this project and how I could improve it. 

## TODO

- improve first activity lifecycle 
- fix second activity display problem
